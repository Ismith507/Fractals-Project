# Fractals-Project

Simple program that allows users to generate different types of fractals and explore the interesting shapes they generate.

Doesnt do much, but hey it works.

Future Plans: \n
  Implement different fractals and strange attractors.\n
  Implement "navigation" fuctionality that lets you zoom in/out and pan across the fractal.\n
  Add an educational component that explains to the user how each fractal is generated and what fractals and strange attractors are.\n
  Turn into a webapp by either rewriting in JavaScript or figuring out how the hell WebAssembly works.\n
