# Fractals-Project

Simple program that allows users to generate different types of fractals and explore the interesting shapes they generate.

Doesnt do much, but hey it works.

Future Plans:  
          * Implement different fractals and strange attractors.  
          * Implement "navigation" fuctionality that lets you zoom in/out and pan across the fractal.  
          * Add an educational component that explains to the user how each fractal is generated and what fractals and strange attractors are.  
          * Turn into a webapp by either rewriting in JavaScript or figuring out how the hell WebAssembly works.
